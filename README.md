# Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia (Python)
Explore, visualize, and understand historical wildfire patterns across Australia through a comprehensive Python-based analysis and interactive mapping.
## Project Overview
This project examines historical wildfire data across Australia (from ~2005 onward), offering insights into temporal and spatial wildfire trends, fire intensity metrics, and regional variations. Visual tools include static plots as well as interactive maps for dynamic exploration.
## Features & Capabilities
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**

     - Load and clean wildfire datasets (estimated fire area, brightness, radiative power, confidence, pixel counts).

     - Parse datetime, compute year/month breakdowns.

- **Visual Analysis:**

    - Line charts for fire area trends over time.

    - Seasonal bar charts to reveal peak months for fire activity.

    - Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots analyzing brightness, radiative power, and confidence distribution.

    - Regional comparisons via bar and pie charts.

- **Interactive Mapping:**

    - Folium-based maps marking fire-prone regions—enhancing geospatial insight. 

- **Insights:**

     - Identify periods of heightened wildfire activity (e.g., 2010–2012).

     - Highlight hotspots such as Northern Territory (NT) and New South Wales (NSW) in brightness and fire incidence. 

     - Explore correlations (and lack thereof) between radiative power and confidence.

## Getting Started
**1. Clone the repository**

```bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd wildfire-australia-analysis
```
**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Likely includes: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`

**3. Explore via Jupyter Notebook**
Launch `notebooks/wildfire_analysis.ipynb` to view the full analysis workflow—data loading, plots, and mapping.

**4. Run interactive visualizations**
Execute `python src/wildfire_dashboard.py` to generate interactive HTML maps and charts.
## Insights & Use Cases
- **Temporal Insights:** Identify months and years with peak fire activity.

- **Spatial Patterns:** Understand which states or territories are more prone to intense or frequent wildfires.

- **Analytical Applications:** Government agencies and environmental organizations can leverage findings for policymaking, while researchers can use this as a foundation for advanced modeling.
## Future Improvements
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive fire risk analysis (e.g., using remote sensing datasets or raster data via `rioxarray`, `xarray`).

- Expand the interactive dashboard with region/year filters.

- Incorporate satellite-derived indices (e.g., NDVI, burn index) to improve fire severity characterization.

- Enable geospatial clustering to detect firefighting hotspots.
